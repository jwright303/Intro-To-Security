Problem 3.4:
  File: hashBreaker.py
  Command: python3 hashBreaker.py
  Notes: Need the pycryptodome/pycryptodomex packages installed to run the programs. Also need the dict.txt file in the same directory
    The plaintext and the ciphertext are also hard coded in the program so no command line prompts are taken and no other files are needed

Problem 3.8:
  File: hashCol.py
  Command: python3 hashCol.py type
    type - Must be replaced with s or w indicating if we are working with strong or weak collision
  Notes: Need the same packages installed as mentioned above
